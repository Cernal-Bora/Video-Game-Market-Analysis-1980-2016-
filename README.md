📊 Key Insights

Video game platforms exhibit a clear life cycle of approximately 5–10 years, where sales rise, peak, and decline after successor platforms are released.

Older platforms experience significant sales drops following the launch of new console generations, indicating market cannibalization.

Action, Sports, and Shooter genres generate the highest global sales, while Strategy and Puzzle games remain niche markets.

Regional preferences vary notably:

North America and Europe favor PlayStation and Xbox platforms

Japan shows stronger performance for Nintendo and handheld platforms

From 2006 to 2016, PS4 and PC emerge as the most stable and profitable platforms.
